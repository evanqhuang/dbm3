# Configuration file for Slab Decompression Model

# Simulation parameters
dt: 0.5           # Time step in seconds (smaller = more precise)
dx: 1.0           # Distance between slices (arbitrary units)
f_o2: 0.21        # Breathing gas O2 fraction (Air = 0.21)
surface_altitude_m: 0.0  # Altitude of the water surface (0m = Sea Level)

# Perfusion model: null = perfect perfusion (classic Hempleman slab).
# With perfect perfusion, the blood-tissue interface (slice 0) instantly
# matches ambient ppN2. Excess gas comes from interior diffusion only.
permeability: null

# Compartment definitions
# v_crit: critical volume threshold (bar*distance)
#   Calibrated at 30m reference depth against Buhlmann ZH-L16C NDL (28min).
#   At the NDL, the controlling compartment has excess_gas = v_crit (risk = 1.0).
