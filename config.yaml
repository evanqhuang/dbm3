# Configuration file for Slab Decompression Model

# Simulation parameters
dt: 0.5           # Time step in seconds (smaller = more precise)
dx: 1.0           # Distance between slices (arbitrary units)
permeability: 0.01  # Blood-tissue barrier permeability
f_o2: 0.21        # Breathing gas O2 fraction (Air = 0.21)
surface_altitude_m: 0.0  # Altitude of the water surface (0m = Sea Level)

# Saturation Limits (conservatism tuning)
# 1.0/1.0 = no conservatism (raw M-values)
# 0.3/0.85 = 30/85 (aggressive recreational)
# 0.2/0.7 = 20/70 (conservative technical)
sat_limit_bottom: 1.0
sat_limit_surface: 1.0

# Compartment definitions
# M-values are derived from D, dx, and permeability (Buhlmann-style a/b parameters)
compartments:
  - name: "Spine"      # Fast, Sensitive
    D: 0.002           # Diffusion coefficient
    slices: 20         # Number of slices

  - name: "Muscle"     # Medium
    D: 0.0005          # Diffusion coefficient
    slices: 20         # Number of slices

  - name: "Joints"     # Slow, traps gas
    D: 0.0001          # Diffusion coefficient
    slices: 20         # Number of slices
